# 3D-Bloch-Visualiser
Overview of the Project Bloch Sphere Explorer: This interactive view would serve to visualize quantum states on the Bloch Sphere. The user provides as input the real and imaginary parts of a quantum state, and it normalizes the input if necessary and produces both a 2D and 3D visualization for the corresponding state on the Bloch Sphere.
